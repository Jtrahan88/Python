#### Goal: Learning how classes are like mini modules.
>> * Similar like import
>> * instantiate = Fancy way to say create

#### Learning Objectives:
 * [Classes](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html)
 > * Classes are like blueprints or definitions for creating new mini-modules
 > * Instantiation is how you make one of these mini-modules and import it at the same time. "Instantiate" just means to create an object from the classes
 > * The resulting created mini-module is called an object, and you then assign it to a variable to work with.
 * Variables.

 > * **Outputs:** the objects of our classes
